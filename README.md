# Uber_Analysis_powerBI

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of Uber ride performance, revenue trends, and driver/rider metrics. The dashboard is designed with a modern, "app-like" interface to allow stakeholders to navigate complex datasets effortlessly and extract actionable insights.

The goal was to simulate a real-world business intelligence environment where data drives decisions regarding fleet management, surge pricing, and geographic expansion.
